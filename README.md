 About This Project

This project is something I built to apply what I’ve learned about data analysis and visualization in a practical way. The main goal was to take a raw sales dataset and turn it into a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard that shows how a business is performing and where it’s heading.

I focused especially on time series analysis to study how sales change over time and to build a 20-day sales forecast. The dashboard helps answer important business questions like:

Which products and categories are selling the most?

Which cities and states generate the highest sales?

How do sales change month by month?

What can we expect sales to look like in the next few weeks?

 What I Wanted to Achieve

Understand real-world business sales data

Create a dashboard that is clear, interactive, and useful

Track key performance indicators like:

Total Sales – 2M

Total Profit – 175K

Quantity Sold – 22K

Practice time series forecasting for short-term sales prediction

Improve my Power BI, DAX, and Power Query skills

 Tools I Used

Power BI for building the dashboard

Power Query to clean and prepare the data

DAX to create measures and KPIs

Excel/CSV as the data source

Power BI built-in forecasting model for time series predictions

 What’s Inside the Dashboard

The dashboard includes:

 KPI cards showing sales, profit, and quantity at a glance

 Monthly line charts comparing sales and profits over time

 Category and sub-category breakdowns using bar charts

 Segment and payment-mode analysis using donut charts

 A map showing state-wise sales distribution

 City-level performance rankings

 A 20-day sales forecast based on past trends

 Interactive filters (region, category, date range etc.) to explore the data easily

 How I Built It

Imported the dataset into Power BI

Cleaned and transformed messy columns using Power Query

Created data relationships and models

Wrote DAX formulas to calculate total sales, profits, and quantity

Designed visuals that tell a clear business story

Added forecasting to predict upcoming sales trends
